 * This file serves as the main entry for Tailwind CSS utilities (imported in main.tsx)
 * and also includes any global or custom CSS overrides. Below, we add custom "block-tail"
 * classes to achieve the "tail" shape on the left side of template blocks, as shown in
 * the project UI mockup. We also define color variations for text, file, and template
 * blocks. 
 *
 * Notes on 'group-hover':
 *  - We rely on Tailwind's group-hover utility for showing reorder/delete buttons on hover.
 *  - We ensure that the parent .group sets "relative" so the absolutely positioned child can appear.

   ==============================================
   Custom "tail" styling for blocks 
   ==============================================
   We define a base .block-tail class that provides a left "arrow" or "tail" shape, 
   plus color-specific variations for 'template', 'text', and 'files' blocks.

   Implementation:
   - We use a pseudo-element ::before to create the triangular shape to the left.
   - We position it absolutely so it overlaps the main block background.
   - The background color of the tail can match or accent the block's background.

  position: relative;

  position: absolute;
  left: -1rem;
  top: 1rem; /* vertical offset so the tail is near the top-edge */

  border: 8px solid transparent; /* triangular shape */
  /* The default color for the tail (we will override for block-tail-purple, etc.) */

   For different block types, we can define different tail colors.
